## Reasons for this project

This site will be used to allow people to post their army lists and recieve feed back on them.

## UX

This site is designed for people who play warhammer 40k, who have made an army list and either want to brag about how good it is or get recommendations on how to improve it. It will give people the abillity to like or dislike the roster and add comments to it also.

### Logs

## Future builds

Future builds will include:
* Back grounds, which will change depending on which faction has been selected.
* The ability to create a unite that is held in a model and add it into the roster rather than creating on a third party app and pasting it in or typing it out in full

## Libraries and other technologies

* HTML
